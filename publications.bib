abstract = {Adversarial attacks on deep neural networks traditionally rely on a constrained optimization paradigm, where an optimization procedure is used to obtain a single adversarial perturbation for a given input example. Here, we instead view adversarial attacks as a generative modelling problem, with the goal of producing entire distributions of adversarial examples given an unperturbed input. We show that this generative perspective can be used to design a unified encoder-decoder framework, which is $\backslash$textit{\{}domain-agnostic{\}} in that the same framework can be employed to attack different domains with minimal modification. Across three diverse domains---images, text, and graphs---our approach generates whitebox attacks with success rates that are competitive with or superior to existing approaches, with a new state-of-the-art achieved in the graph domain. Finally, we demonstrate that our generative framework can efficiently generate a diverse set of attacks for a single given input, and is even capable of attacking $\backslash$textit{\{}unseen{\}} test instances in a zero-shot manner, exhibiting {\{}$\backslash$em attack generalization.}},

@article{Morris2018,
abstract = {In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful neural architecture to learn vector representations of nodes and graphs in a supervised, end-to-end fashion. Up to now, GNNs have only been evaluated empirically---showing promising results. The following work investigates GNNs from a theoretical point of view and relates them to the {\$}1{\$}-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman graph isomorphism heuristic ({\$}1{\$}-WL). We show that GNNs have the same expressiveness as the {\$}1{\$}-WL in terms of distinguishing non-isomorphic (sub-)graphs. Hence, both algorithms also have the same shortcomings. Based on this, we propose a generalization of GNNs, so-called {\$}k{\$}-dimensional GNNs ({\$}k{\$}-GNNs), which can take higher-order graph structures at multiple scales into account. These higher-order structures play an essential role in the characterization of social networks and molecule graphs. Our experimental evaluation confirms our theoretical findings as well as confirms that higher-order information is useful in the task of graph classification and regression.},
